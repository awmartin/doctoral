# Doctoral

[Doctoral](https://doctoral.app) is a document app _a la_ Dropbox Paper and Google Docs built with privacy in mind.

Built with Node.js and Vue.js, Doctoral can be hosted on Google Firebase, locally, or on cloud services like Heroku, Cloud Foundry, or just a VM.

It will support several popular open source editors (CKEditor, Quill, Editor.js, TinyMCE). Licensing the one you want is up to you. Most development currently is for CKEditor.

## Why?

I like online doc editors a lot, like Google Docs and Dropbox Paper, but I liked the idea of having a flexible self-hosted document platform that one could adapt to one's needs, especially around privacy. So features like encryption will be coming soon.

So Doctoral is for anyone to host on their own, either on the cloud or locally, and to contribute to. A [hosted alternative to Google Docs and Dropbox Paper](https://doctoral.app) I also provide for anyone to use.

## Features

Doctoral is just a minimal document editor and organizer with editing, organizing with folders, versioning, history, and a few other basic features like tags and starring. The version I host at <https://doctoral.app> enables publishing documents as web pages and a few other niceties.

## Contributing

Coming soon.

## License

Coming soon.
