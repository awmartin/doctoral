# Doctoral

[Doctoral](https://doctoral.app) is a document app _a la_ Dropbox Paper and Google Docs built with privacy in mind.

It's built with Node.js and Vue.js and can be hosted on Google Firebase, locally, or on cloud services like Heroku, Cloud Foundry, or just a VM.

It will support several popular open source editors (CKEditor, Quill, Editor.js, TinyMCE). Licensing the one you want is up to you. Most development currently is for CKEditor.

## Why?

I like online doc editors a lot, like Google Docs and Dropbox Paper, but I've felt a bit odd recently about them hosting my data, and there have been times when I've wanted particular features and could quite find the right fit for my needs.

As far as privacy, online editors can be a bit of a risk. Dropbox Paper creates docs with world-readable permissions _by default_, which is a bit odd to me. And if one were to lose access to one's Google Docs account, the impact could be disastrous.

So I made Doctoral to enable anyone with a bit of tech-savviness to host their own online document editor and manager, either on the cloud or locally on their own machines. Or for the less tech-savvy, a [hosted alternative to Google Docs](https://doctoral.app) that is open source and thus provides insights into feature development that you typically don't get from big companies. 

## Features

Doctoral is just a minimal document editor and organizer with editing, organizing with folders, versioning, history, and a few other basic features. The version I host at <https://doctoral.app> enables publishing documents as web pages and a few other niceties.
