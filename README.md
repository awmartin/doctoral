# Doctoral

Doctoral is a document app _a la_ Dropbox Paper and Google Docs with privacy in mind.

It's backed by Google Cloud Firebase and runs with open source Vue.js components.

It supports several popular editors (CKEditor, Quill, Editor.js). Licensing those are up to you.

## Why?

I like online text editors a lot, like Google Docs and Dropbox Paper, but I've always felt a bit odd about having big companies hosting my data. Paper also creates docs with world-readable premissions by default, and Dropbox itself has a number of security issues to this day that remain unaddressed. And if one were to ever lose access to their own Google account, the impact could be disastrous.

So I made Doctoral to enable anyone with a bit of tech-savviness could host their own document editor, so at least they have their own content, even if they lose access to their Google Cloud account.

The app is just a minimal document editor and organizer with sharing, publishing, and folders. That's it. If you're a coder, you can use this as a foundation for hosting your own personal apps.

I may even wrap this in Electron so folks can have a desktop version.
